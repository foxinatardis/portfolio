                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    <p>Safety Net is an Android app, available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.safetynet875935&hl=en">Google Play Store</a>, designed to help alleviate fear. Inspired by a mother's constant worry for her children.</p>
                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>Say you are getting out of work late at night, the walk to your car or home is dark, sketchy, crossing territory that sends a shiver up your spine. How long should that walk take, 5, 10 minutes max? Set a Safety Net timer. If something happens and you are unable to turn off the timer, a message will be sent to your chosen contacts with a Google Maps link to your location. Help is on the way!</p>
                    <h4>What technologies does it use?</h4>
                    <p>Safety Net is an open source project hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/foxinatardis/Safety-Net">GitHub Repository</a>. Built using Ionic 2 to transpile Angular 2 with TypeScript for Android devices, Cordova plugins provide the native device functionality required for accessing contacts, geolocation, and SMS services.</p>
                    <h4>The Why's of Safety Net</h4>
                    <p><strong>Why is it free?</strong> Because the world could use a bit less fear. Safety Net is free to download, free to use, and free of advertisements. People should not profit from fear.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why is it open source?</strong> Because I'm not perfect, and I'm certainly not a graphic designer. If anyone has improvments to functionality or style that they would like to submit, I would be more than happy to include them in this project.</p>

                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>I spent a year building up this application under contract to Buink Web Development. What we created in that time is a three tiered application including:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A custom content management system where creators can upload content to be bundled and sold by labels and fests.</li>
                        <li>A video-on-demand platform where users preview and consume purchased content.</li>
                        <li>A custom sales platform tying things together to ensure users have proper access to content, and that creators and labels get paid appropriately.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I joined the team in January of 2017 when the project was reaching the final months of its proof-of-concept phase. During this time I had the pleasure of adding additional features to the CMS, integrating the Brightcove video player, building the video security system, and creating a custom database seeding program to expedite development and testing.</p>
                    <p>Once our POC was completed I was able to do a deep dive into the pre-existing codebase tracking down memory leaks, trimming down unneccessary APIs, and refactoring endpoints and database queries to improve the efficiency, and scalability of our backend. After a few more features were fleshed out, it was time to finish things off with some cutting edge CSS to create a unique and responsive interface.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the year, the user experience had been polished and beta content was being uploaded to the live site in preparation for full launch. Overall the project was a great experience and I really enjoyed the opportunity to work with some great people over at Buink writing clean, maintainable code.</p>

                    <p>Built using Phaser.io, it is a JavaScript based HTML5 game which uses WebGL or Canvas depending on browser compatablility.</p>

                    <p>It was a fun way to play around with a new JavaScript library, and made a great Christmas present for a neice who is constantly jumping around.</p>

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>For this project I had two weeks to create a fully functional POC for a mobile AR game where friends hunt each other down in the real world using the geopositioning capabilities built into their cellular devices. My favorite part of this project was leveraging Socket.io for its realtime communication capabilites; this, combined with the phone's built in compass, is what allowed players to efficiently track their opponent's movements on a "radar" display.</p>
                    <p>Using the MEAN stack to assemble the project as a web application was a quick and easy way to get things up and running. An extra advantage to this approach was that using Angular 2 with TypeScript, it would be easy to convert into a mobile app for either iOS or Android by using Cordova and the Ionic framework if it was desirable to move the project further forward.</p>
                    <p>I had a lot of fun getting this app up and running while learning to make practical use of some new technologies like websockets and the location API. In the future it would be interesting to revisit this project; incorporating facial recognition features would be a major goal, while adding microtransactions for in-game "power-ups" could create a more exciting and varied gameplay experience.</p>
