                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    <p>Safety Net is an Android app, available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.safetynet875935&hl=en">Google Play Store</a>, designed to help alleviate fear. Inspired by a mother's constant worry for her children.</p>
                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>Say you are getting out of work late at night, the walk to your car or home is dark, sketchy, crossing territory that sends a shiver up your spine. How long should that walk take, 5, 10 minutes max? Set a Safety Net timer. If something happens and you are unable to turn off the timer, a message will be sent to your chosen contacts with a Google Maps link to your location. Help is on the way!</p>
                    <h4>What technologies does it use?</h4>
                    <p>Safety Net is an open source project hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/foxinatardis/Safety-Net">GitHub Repository</a>. Built using Ionic 2 to transpile Angular 2 with TypeScript for Android devices, Cordova plugins provide the native device functionality required for accessing contacts, geolocation, and SMS services.</p>
                    <h4>The Why's of Safety Net</h4>
                    <p><strong>Why is it free?</strong> Because the world could use a bit less fear. Safety Net is free to download, free to use, and free of advertisements. People should not profit from fear.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why is it open source?</strong> Because I'm not perfect, and I'm certainly not a graphic designer. If anyone has improvments to functionality or style that they would like to submit, I would be more than happy to include them in this project.</p>
