				<h1>Adam Belliveau</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Adam Belliveau, a 32 year old <span class="bold">Web Developer</span> living in Boulder, CO. I recently became a graduate of <a href="https://www.codecraftschool.com/">CodeCraft School of Technology</a> where I learned to take my passion for fixing things into the worlds of <span class="bold">jQuery</span>, <span class="bold">Node.js</span>, and <span class="bold">Angular 2</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Growing up as the child of a software engineer, I first tried to learn C++ at the age of 12. As you might imagine this did not go so well. My childish impatience did not mix well with the idea of hunting down misplaced semi-colons, and I was scared away from coding for two decades.
				</p>
				<p>
					After spending 5 years working in Human Services as a counselor for traumatized teens, I decided to make a career change. Some soul searching ensued, including a move across the country from Massachusetts to Colorado in pursuit of bigger mountains to climb. Finally I realized that my passion for <span class="bold">problem solving</span>, and inate ability to quickly <span class="bold">master new skills</span>, was a natural and perfect fit for the world of computer programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of personal programming projects my hobbies include mountain biking, rock climbing, and adventure photography.
				</p>

					<h3 class="subHeader">The Most Dangerous Game<span class="projectDetail">Full Stack Developer</span></h3>
					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>
						This app was created as my final project for CodeCraft. It is a multi-player, geolocation based game where you hunt down your friends in the real world using the GPS in your phone. Last person standing wins.
					</p>
					<h4>Technology Used: </h4>
					<p>
						The Most Dangerous Game uses a server based on <span class="bold">Node.js</span>, <span class="bold">Express.js</span>, and <span class="bold">Socket.io</span> to handle real-time communication between players as they hunt eachother down. A <span class="bold">Mongo</span> database is utilized for persistant storage, and the power of <span class="bold">Angular 2</span> takes care of the front-end framework.
					</p>
					<h4>Where is it now:</h4>
					<p>
						Currently in alpha testing at <a href="https://themdg.win">www.themdg.win</a> Designed to be a mobile-only app, once a few more features are fleshed out, and the user experience is streamlined it will be compiled for both iOS and Android.

					<h3 class="subHeader">cubeMaze<span class="projectDetail">Developer</span></h3>
					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>
						This is essentially a few hundred lines of JavaScript to construct a randomized maze of rooms contained within a cube of specified dimensions. It will return an array with a <span class="bold">linked list</span> of those rooms, along with an array off the coordinates of all valid rooms within the original cube.
					</p>
					<h4>Technology Used:</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Vanilla JavaScript</span>
					</p>
					<h4>Where is it now:</h4>
					<p>
						Up on GitHub free for anyone to use and adapt to their specific needs. I have personally played around with it for the creation of self-generating text adventures, and look forward to utilizing it alongside a 3D game engine in the future.

					<h3 class="subHeader">This WebPage<span class="projectDetail">Developer/Designer</span></h3>
					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>
						This page is built from the ground up with <span class="bold">jQuery,</span> <span class="bold">Velocity.js,</span> the <span class="bold">jQuery scrollTo</span> plug-in, <span class="bold">AND</span> a day of hard work. No template was used in the construction of this page. It is being served off a <span class="bold">Linux</span> based server from Digital Ocean using an <span class="bold">Express</span> app I built.
					</p>
					<h4>Technology Used:</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">HTML5</span>: basic construction<br>
						<span class="bold">CSS3</span>: basic styling<br>
						<span class="bold">jQuery</span>: easy element grabbing and scrolling<br>
						<span class="bold">Velocity.js</span>: element animations<br>
						<span class="bold">Node.js</span>: JavaScript server<br>
						<span class="bold">Expres.js</span>: server framework
					</p>
					<h4>Where is it now:</h4>
					<p>
						Right here. The site will continue to undergo revisions as time allows. There are some other fun things I would like to do to it, but I do have other projects to attend to.

					<h3 class="subHeader">Rock Climbing</h3>
					<p>
						These past couple of years I have been pushing my boundaries in the area of Trad Climbing. I find this activity much more intimidating than Sport Climbing and it really forces me to challenge myself mentally even more so than it does physically. Don't know what Trad Climbing is? Go here: <a href="http://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4635/whats-the-difference-between-sport-climbing-and-traditional-climbing">Trad vs Sport Climbing.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of my favorite places to climb have been <a href="http://www.climbing.com/places/the-gunks-new-york-climbing-destination-guide/">The Gunks</a> in NY, the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/st-vrain-canyons/107839313">St. Vrain Canyon</a> in CO, and <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/grand-teton/105803123">The Tetons</a> in WY.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Adobe Spark site I built to tell the story of my father and I attempting to summit the Grand Teton via the Exum Ridge in July 2016 can be found here: <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/rmnfS/">Full Exum Attempt, all photos taken by Adam's iPhone 5S.</a> Once I have finished a few other personal projects I have been working on I will go back and rebuild the site without Adobe to improve its responsiveness.

					<h3 class="subHeader">Mountain Biking</h3>
					<p>
						A sport I gave up for years after a pair of gnarly crashes shook my nerves, upon moving to Colorado the bug bit me again. A great passtime on days when climbing partners are hard to find, the beautiful landscapes of Colorado have really inspired me to get out and ride. A big shout out to the <a href="https://bouldermountainbike.org/">Boulder Mountainbike Alliance</a> for all the hard work they put in to make the area a great place for everyone to enjoy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Heil Valley Ranch is one of my favorite biking locales near Boulder, the Wapiti trail there is a quad burner on the way up, and a blast on the way down. The Ponderosa Loop is fantastically flowy fun with a great view a couple of miles in. The Picture Rock trail can be a great way to get to the top if you want to aboid the burnination caused by the Wapiti Trail and affords a less technical but still wickedly fun descent.
